---------

## Only 3 steps to make your json file to fully functional REST API with JWT token auth.

#### 1 
Add your JSON data under `database/collections` folder. (There are two sample json dbs called `posts` and `cars`)

#### 2
Change username and password or add new users in `database/config.php` file. 

#### 3
Delare routes inside main `index.php`

Examples

**Public Route**
```php

  $router->get('/posts',function(){
      $posts = DB::table("posts")->all();
      echo json_encode($posts);
  });
  
```

**Protected Route**
```php
if($auth->routes()){

  $router->get('/posts',function(){
      $posts = DB::table("posts")->all();
      echo json_encode($posts);
  });
  
}
```

> Here, you'll see the database queries but most are very similar with Laravel eloquent.

------- 

That's it, just upload on hosting or serve via xampp/mamp and you're ready to fetch data via REST API.
